# whoru
whoru is a command line tool that query name/version/arch of a linux distribution. it's like whoami, which query the uid/name/group of a user.

 - WHORU\_DIST   = distribution name
 - WHORU\_VER    = version
 - WHORU\_ARCH   = architecture

## Example

![whoru on debian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixia/whoru/master/whoru-debian.png)
![whoru on fedora](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixia/whoru/master/whoru-fedora.png)
![whoru on macos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixia/whoru/master/whoru-mac_os.png)
 
## Installation

Copy `whoru` file to /usr/local/bin, or anywhere that PATH could find.

## Bug

From now, whoru is very simple and only support very limited linux distribution, for example: redhat, fedora, centos, debian, mac os . 

contribution is very welcome.
