# What is _whoru_?
*whoru* is a command line tool that query name/version/arch of a linux distribution. it's like whoami, which query the uid/name/group of a user.

 - WHORU\_DIST   = distribution name
 - WHORU\_VER    = version
 - WHORU\_ARCH   = architecture

## Usage

```bash
$ eval $(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixia/whoru/master/whoru | bash -)

```
